>Rust port of [jp](https://github.com/therealklanni/jp)

**WARNING!**

- ~~This is a pre-alpha version in the very early stages of development~~ Pretty stable, but not feature-complete
- This is my first Rust program
- ~~The code is terrible right now~~ It got better
- ~~Proceed with caution~~ What could go wrong?

Please check back soon for a v1.0! It's coming...

Pull-requests are welcome!
